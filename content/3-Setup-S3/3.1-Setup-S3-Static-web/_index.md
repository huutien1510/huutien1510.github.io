To create a policy for the bucket, in Step 1, select **S3 Bucket Policy**, in addition, you can create policies for SQS, VPC, IAM and SNS depending on the type of server that you need to perform.

In Step 2 - Principal, we set the value to * to allow all sources to access the bucket.

In the **Index document** section, enter the file name you want to display first, or maybe as the homepage. Leave the same name as the file uploaded to the Bucket. **Error document** if you code a file to display website errors, you can upload it and leave the name of that file, here because there is no file to display errors in the interface, you can leave the file name as **Index document**.
